# 6.7 Class Attributes

## Part 1: Code Along

1. Follow along as I add a class to the first h1 in HTML.
2. Then, in CSS, use that class as a selector. Remember to add a dot (.) in front of it to show that it's a class.
3. Finally, write the CSS rule to turn that first h1 green.
4. Let's do the second one together.

## Part 2: Code It Solo
5. Follow the same steps to turn the third h1 purple. First, add a class.
6. Then, head to CSS. Use that class as a selector. Finally, write the rule to turn it purple.
7. Now do the same thing for the three paragraphs.

## Part 3: Extension 
8. Add at least three more CSS rules to style the elements individually.
9. 
**Examples**:
- Add a highlight to one h1.
- Change the text-shadow of one p tag.
- Change the alignment (left, center, right) of one element.
- Make it so that one element changes color when you hover over it.
